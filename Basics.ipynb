    "# Clean and Analyze Employee Exit Surveys\n",
    "We will work with exit surveys from employees of the [Department of Ecudation, Training and Employment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_(Queensland) (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) in Queensland, Australia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset of the DETE may be found [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey). As for the TAFE exit survey dataset, it is no longer available online.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are to play the role of a data analyst and pretend our stakeholders want to know the following:\n",
    "- Are the employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resignijng due to some kind of dissattisfaction? What about employees who have been here longer?\n",
    "- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?\n",
    "\n",
    "They want us to combine the the results for both surveys to answer these questions. Even though both used the same survey template, one of them customized some of the answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring the Dataset\n",
    "Below is a preview of a couple of columns we will work with from the `dete_survey.csv`:\n",
    "- `ID`: An id used to identify the participant of the survey,\n",
    "- `SeparationType`: The reason why the person's employment ended,\n",
    "- `Cease Date`: The year or month the person's employment ended\n",
    "- `DETE Start Date`: The year the person began employment with the DETE\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a preview of a couple columns we'll work with from the `tafe_survey.csv`:\n",
    "- `Record ID`: An id used to identify the participant of the survey\n",
    "- `Reason for ceasing employment`: The reason why the person's employment ended\n",
    "- `LengthofServiceOverall. Overall Length of Service at Institute (in years)`: The length of the person's employment (in years)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that this is an experimentation project to showcase cleaning skills, we will work  with a data dictionary made by our knowledge, given that there is no project manager to verify the data dictionary with.\n",
    "\n",
    "We must start by reading the datasets into pandas and exploring them.\n"
